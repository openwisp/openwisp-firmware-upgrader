Channels augments Django to bring WebSocket, long-poll HTTP,
task offloading and other async support to your code, using familiar Django
design patterns and a flexible underlying framework that lets you not only
customize behaviours but also write support for your own protocols and needs.

Documentation, installation and getting started instructions are at
https://channels.readthedocs.io

Channels is an official Django Project and as such has a deprecation policy.
Details about what's deprecated or pending deprecation for each release is in
the `release notes <https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/index.html>`_.

Support can be obtained through several locations - see our
`support docs <https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support.html>`_ for more.

You can install channels from PyPI as the ``channels`` package.
