# Service Identity Verification for pyOpenSSL & *cryptography*

Use this package if:

- you want to **verify** that a [PyCA *cryptography*](https://cryptography.io/) certificate is valid for a certain hostname or IP address,
- or if you use [pyOpenSSL](https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/) and don’t want to be [**MITM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)ed,
- or if you want to **inspect** certificates from either for service IDs.

*service-identity* aspires to give you all the tools you need for verifying whether a certificate is valid for the intended purposes.
In the simplest case, this means *host name verification*.
However, *service-identity* implements [RFC 6125](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6125.html) fully.

Also check out [*pem*](https://github.com/hynek/pem) that makes loading certificates from all kinds of PEM-encoded files a breeze!


## Project Information

*service-identity* is released under the [MIT](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/blob/main/LICENSE) license, its documentation lives at [Read the Docs](https://service-identity.readthedocs.io/), the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity), and the latest release on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/service-identity/).


### Credits

*service-identity* is written and maintained by [Hynek Schlawack](https://hynek.me/).

The development is kindly supported by my employer [Variomedia AG](https://www.variomedia.de/), *service-identity*'s [Tidelift subscribers](https://tidelift.com/lifter/search/pypi/service-identity), and all my amazing [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hynek).


### *service-identity* for Enterprise

Available as part of the [Tidelift Subscription](https://tidelift.com/?utm_source=lifter&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hynek).

The maintainers of *service-identity* and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open-source packages you use to build your applications.
Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact packages you use.


## Release Information

### Added

- Python 3.13 is now officially supported.
  [#74](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/pull/74)


### Changed

- pyOpenSSL's identity extraction has been reimplemented using *cryptography*'s primitives instead of deprecated pyOpenSSL APIs.
  As a result, the oldest supported pyOpenSSL version is now 17.1.0.
  [#70](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/pull/70)
