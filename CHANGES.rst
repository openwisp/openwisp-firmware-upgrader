Changes
-------

Backward incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- REST APIs are enabled by default. You can disable them by setting
  ``OPENWISP_FIRMWARE_UPGRADER_API`` to ``False``.
- Changed REST API prefix from ``/upgrader/`` to ``/firmware-upgrader/``.
  This makes it consistent with REST API endpoints of other modules

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Dropped support for Python 3.6
- Dropped support for Django 2.2
- Added support for Python 3.8 and 3.9
- Added support for Django 3.2 and 4.0
- Upgraded openwisp-controller to 1.0.x

Other changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Avoid deletion of ``UpgradeOperation`` when related
  ``Firmware Image`` is deleted
- Increased default retries in OpenWRT upgrader from
  ``15`` to ``40``
- Made firmware upgrade logs translatable
- Changed the default API throttle rate from ``400/hour`` to ``1000/minute``
- Added time limits to ``openwisp_firmware_upgrader.tasks.create_device_firmware``
  and ``openwisp_firmware_upgrader.tasks.create_all_device_firmwares`` celery tasks

Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed firmware checksum check
- Improved error handling for upgrade operations
- Remove openwisp-config persistent checksum:
  openwisp-config 0.6.0 makes the checksum persistent,
  but this causes upgraded devices to not download the configuration
  again after the upgrade, which is an issue if the configuration
  contains any file which is not stored in ``/etc/``.
- Fixed a bug which caused ``Server 500`` error on creating a new
  ``Build`` object if ``category`` field was left empty
- Fixed bugs in restoring deleted devices using ``django-reversion``
- Fixed migrations referencing non-swappable OpenWISP modules
  that broke OpenWISP's extensibility

Version 0.1.1 [2021-01-08]
--------------------------

- [fix] Fixed ``os_identifier`` validation bug in ``Build`` model.

Version 0.1.0 [2020-11-27]
--------------------------

First release.
