Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed `issues in reconnecting to device after firmware upgrade
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-firmware-upgrader/issues/235>`_.
- `Use storage backend method for deleting FirmwareImage.file
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-firmware-upgrader/pull/203>`_.

  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-firmware-upgrader/issues/246>`_.

Version 1.0.1 [2022-06-10]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed `hardcoded storage backend of the "FirmwareImage.file" field
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-firmware-upgrader/issues/195>`_.
  ``FirmwareImage.file`` was configured to use
  ``PrivateFileSystemStorage``, which made it impossible to use other
  private storage backends. The
  `"OPENWISP_FIRMWARE_PRIVATE_STORAGE_INSTANCE"
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-firmware-upgrader#openwisp_firmware_private_storage_instance>`_
  setting is added to make the ``FirmwareImage.file`` storage
  configurable.
- Fixed `inconsistent URL keyword argument in "serve_private_file" URL
  pattern
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-firmware-upgrader/issues/197>`_.
  This broke the reverse proxy feature of `django-private-storage
  <https://github.com/edoburu/django-private-storage>`_.

Changes
~~~~~~~

Backward incompatible changes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- REST APIs are enabled by default. You can disable them by setting
  ``OPENWISP_FIRMWARE_UPGRADER_API`` to ``False``.
- Changed REST API prefix from ``/upgrader/`` to ``/firmware-upgrader/``.
  This makes it consistent with REST API endpoints of other modules

Dependencies
++++++++++++

- Dropped support for Python 3.6
- Dropped support for Django 2.2
- Added support for Python 3.8 and 3.9
- Added support for Django 3.2 and 4.0
- Upgraded openwisp-controller to 1.0.x

Other changes
+++++++++++++

- Avoid deletion of ``UpgradeOperation`` when related ``Firmware Image``
  is deleted
- Increased default retries in OpenWRT upgrader from ``15`` to ``40``
- Made firmware upgrade logs translatable
- Changed the default API throttle rate from ``400/hour`` to
  ``1000/minute``
- Added time limits to
  ``openwisp_firmware_upgrader.tasks.create_device_firmware`` and
  ``openwisp_firmware_upgrader.tasks.create_all_device_firmwares`` celery
  tasks

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed firmware checksum check
- Improved error handling for upgrade operations
- Remove openwisp-config persistent checksum: openwisp-config 0.6.0 makes
  the checksum persistent, but this causes upgraded devices to not
  download the configuration again after the upgrade, which is an issue if
  the configuration contains any file which is not stored in ``/etc/``.
- Fixed a bug which caused ``Server 500`` error on creating a new
  ``Build`` object if ``category`` field was left empty
- Fixed bugs in restoring deleted devices using ``django-reversion``
- Fixed migrations referencing non-swappable OpenWISP modules that broke
  OpenWISP's extensibility

Version 0.1.1 [2021-01-08]
--------------------------

- [fix] Fixed ``os_identifier`` validation bug in ``Build`` model.

Version 0.1.0 [2020-11-27]
--------------------------

First release.
