Requirements
------------

- Devices running at least OpenWrt 12.09 Attitude Adjustment, older
  versions of OpenWrt have not worked at all in our tests
- Devices must have enough free RAM to be able to upload the new image to
  ``/tmp``

1. Create a Category
--------------------

Create a category for your firmware images by going to *Firmware
management > Firmware categories > Add firmware category*, if you use only
one firmware type in your network, you could simply name the category
"default" or "standard".

    :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openwisp/openwisp-firmware-upgrader/docs/docs/images/quickstart-category.gif

If you use multiple firmware images with different features, create one
category for each firmware type, eg:

- WiFi
- SDN router
- LoRa Gateway

This is necessary in order to perform mass upgrades only on specific
firmware categories when, for example, a new *LoRa Gateway* firmware
becomes available.

2. Create the Build Object
--------------------------

Create a build object by going to *Firmware management > Firmware builds >
Add firmware build*, the build object is related to a firmware category
and is the collection of the different firmware images which have been
compiled for the different hardware models supported by the system.

The version field indicates the firmware version, the change log field is
optional but we recommend filling it to help operators know the
differences between each version.

An important but optional field of the build model is **OS identifier**,
this field should match the value of the **Operating System** field which
gets automatically filled during device registration, eg: ``OpenWrt
19.07-SNAPSHOT r11061-6ffd4d8a4d``. It is used by the firmware-upgrader
module to automatically create ``DeviceFirmware`` objects for existing
devices or when new devices register. A ``DeviceFirmware`` object
represent the relationship between a device and a firmware image, it
basically tells us which firmware image is installed on the device.

To find out the exact value to use, you should either do a test flash on a
device and register it to the system or you should inspect the firmware
image by decompressing it and find the generated value in the firmware
image.

If you're not sure about what **OS identifier** to use, just leave it
empty, you can fill it later on when you find out.

Now save the build object to create it.

3. Upload Images to the Build
-----------------------------

Now is time to add images to the build, we suggest adding one image at
time. Alternatively the :doc:`REST API <rest-api>` can be used to automate
this step.

    :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openwisp/openwisp-firmware-upgrader/docs/docs/images/quickstart-firmwareimage.gif

If you use a hardware model which is not listed in the image types, if the
hardware model is officially supported by OpenWrt, you can send us a
pull-request to add it, otherwise you can use :ref:`the setting
OPENWISP_CUSTOM_OPENWRT_IMAGES <openwisp_custom_openwrt_images>` to add
it.

4. Perform a Firmware Upgrade to a Specific Device
--------------------------------------------------

Once a new build is ready, has been created in the system and its image
have been uploaded, it will be the time to finally upgrade our devices.

To perform the upgrade of a single device, navigate to the device details,
then go to the "Firmware" tab.

If you correctly filled **OS identifier** in step 2, you should have a
situation similar to the one above: in this example, the device is using
version ``1.0`` and we want to upgrade it to version ``2.0``, once the new
firmware image is selected we just have to hit save, then a new tab will
appear in the device page which allows us to see what's going on during
the upgrade.

Right now, the update of the upgrade information is not asynchronous yet,
so you will have to reload the page periodically to find new information.
This will be addressed in a future release.

5. Performing Mass Upgrades
---------------------------

Before proceeding, please ensure the following preconditions are met:

- the system is configured correctly
- the new firmware images are working as expected
- you already tried the upgrade of single devices several times.

At this stage you can try a mass upgrade by doing the following:

- go to the build list page
- select the build which contains the latest firmware images you want the
  devices to be upgraded with
- click on "Mass-upgrade devices related to the selected build".

    :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openwisp/openwisp-firmware-upgrader/docs/docs/images/quickstart-batch-upgrade.gif

At this point you should see a summary page which will inform you of which
devices are going to be upgraded, you can either confirm the operation or
cancel.

Once the operation is confirmed you will be redirected to a page in which
you can monitor the progress of the upgrade operations.

Right now, the update of the upgrade information is not asynchronous yet,
so you will have to reload the page periodically to find new information.
This will be addressed in a future release.
